					<h2>1. Why did you choose to major in computer science? </h2>
					<h1></h1>
						<li> "I didn’t know what computer science was until senior year, 
							but the new AP Computer Science Principles at my school helped 
							me to see everything that computer science can do!  In the AP 
							CSP class they taught us that you will find applications of computer 
							science in many different industries, even ones that might seem really
							different from math or engineering. After that, I decided to study computer 
							science to find out how computers work and how we can use them to extend many
							different areas of society and art!"</li>
							<h1></h1>
						<h2>2.  Has UCLA allowed you to pursue your engineering goals so far? </h2>
						<h1></h1>
						<li> "I noticed that UCLA does a lot to help you look for outside opportunities. 
							I think that the career fair is a big one for me, since so many of us are 
							looking for industry experience when we’re upperclassmen, but also a lot of 
							workshops have been going around for us that I really appreciate.
							And I’m not sure if this is UCLA or student run clubs, but I think 
							the clubs at UCLA are a really big part of reaching “my engineering goals” 
							too since they are the ones who really work with you on making projects, learning 
							new tools/tech, and bringing your goals together on your resume! For me a lot of 
							that is arts and mentorship related, so Creative Labs and ACM have been a really 
							big part of finding ways to pursue my goals outside the classrooms here. Also, UCLA’s
							opportunities for being student mentors." </li>
							<h1></h1>
							
							<h2>3. Is there any advice that you’d give your freshman self? </h2>
							<h1></h1>
							<li>
							"I think I would say so many things because I have so many regrets. 
							All of those regrets are related to not trying to do something or not 
							asking for information/opportunities because I didn’t feel qualified or
							because I was nervous to bother somebody. It is so important to have 
							confidence that you can succeed or that you are not a burden — whether 
							it’s in a midterm, applying to a club committee, or working on a side project.
							I feel like I really didn’t take advantage of a lot of things or try a lot of things
						because I was too nervous or embarrassed to ask or to fail. But I realize now that 
							the fear of failure is ironically why I feel like I’ve failed as a junior."</li>
