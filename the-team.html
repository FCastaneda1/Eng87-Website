					<p>I want to pursue engineering because they revolutionize new ages within our society. From the basic construction of the arch by the Romans to the invention of the light bulb by Edison, engineers create a huge leap forward in what we can do. I am personally most interested in quantum technology because I see that as the next big jump in computing akin to the creation of the transistor.</p>

					<h2>UCLA '23 - Computer Engineering</h2>
					<p>I chose to pursue engineering because I wanted to apply what I learned in math and science into everyday life. As an engineer, I hope to contribute to ideas and technology that will shape our future. The idea of working on things that will make a difference is what motivates me to continue working hard. The field I am most interested in is Quantum Computing. Quantum physics alone is a fascinating field and I would love to apply those ideas towards increasing the processing speed of computers.</p>

					<h2>UCLA '23 - Computer Science</h2>
					<p>I wanted to become an engineer after taking a coding course my sophomore year of high school. I programmed a robotic car and it was really fun. I decided to further explore by trying to develop an app. Although it did not turn out how I wanted it to, it led me to computer science. In addition to this exploration during high school, I have always had a deep passion for technology. I enjoy learning about new discoveries and I hope to participate in these discoveries through computer science.</p>

					<h1>Ruben De La Torre</h1>
					<h2>UCLA '23 - Electrical Engineering</h2>
					<p>At first glance, I decided that I wanted to be an engineer because I enjoyed both math and science throughout my education. However, another interest of mine is helping others, whether that be directly or indirectly. An outlet that would allow me to pursue both of my interests was electrical engineering. For instance, Iâ€™m interested in maximizing electrical energy efficiency because overconsumption affects everyone. Reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy will only further pollute the atmosphere so I believe that optimizing our electricity consumption can help reduce this pollution. I want to contribute to the innovation of electronics that allows industries to produce as much, if not more output, through the use of less energy.</p>
